Detective Mystery Game
Game Background:
Step into the shoes of a detective investigating a murder at the ominous Winston Manor. When the wealthy lord is found dead, five suspects - each with motives, secrets and questionable alibis - become your prime targets. Time is limited and every clue counts in this race against the clock.

Gameplay & Features:
  This turn-based mystery challenges players to:
     Explore atmospheric locations (crime scene, study, garden etc.)
     Collect clues (30% are red herrings like "expired milk")
     Combine evidence (e.g. "wet mud" + "garden key")
  Interrogate suspects with unique:
     Alibis ("Was cleaning silver")
     Motives ("Overheard firing plans")
     Secrets ("Gambling debts")

Key Rules:
  10 default moves (each action consumes 1)
  Correct accusation requires:
     Identifying the killer
     Presenting 2 key clues
  Fail conditions:
     Wrong accusation → Killer escapes
     No moves left → Case goes cold

Why It Stands Out:
  Dynamic Clue System - Logical combinations reveal truths
  Replayability - Random culprits & clue distributions
  Tactical Depth - Limited moves demand strategy
  Authentic Deduction - Analyze:
      Timeline contradictions ("Fresh mud on 'sleeping' gardener")
      Motive strengths (Financial > Personal)

Sample Victory:
  "Convicted the chef using the poison vial and ledger with 2 moves remaining!"

Difficulty Options:
  Easy (15 moves, 20% red herrings)
  Hard (8 moves, 50% red herrings)

Can you outsmart the killer? The manor awaits your investigation!
